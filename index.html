              <p>Hi! My name is Sylvia Jonon. I have just started the Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin, and I am absolutely
                loving every
                minute of it!
                I chose to enroll in this boot camp for a few reasons. As a parent, I have very little time to dedicate
                to my own
                development; the thought of attempting to teach myself to code was incredibly daunting. I previously
                thought I would
                have to pursue a masters in order to have an instructor and support team to aid my learning. When I saw
                a link to the
                Coding Boot Camp in a UT alumni email, I couldn't believe I could study and build a portfolio over the
                course of a 12
                week period.
                I am so excited to to learn the skills I need to change a career and pursue my dream job. I am also
                thrilled to be able
                to show my daughter and her friends that women can pursue careers in any field they choose at any stage
                of their life.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>After completion of Coding Boot Camp, I hope to not only land my dream job but also plan to assist my
                husband with
                creating and maintaining websites (and possibly apps in the future) for his record label and non-profit
                music
                festival. Feel free to reach out and connect with me, I'd love to talk code!
              </p>
